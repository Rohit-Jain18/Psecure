This Password Manager application is built using the following technologies:
Kotlin: The app is developed primarily using Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development known for its conciseness and safety features.
Jetpack Compose: We leverage Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native Android UIs, to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Room Database: For secure and efficient data storage, we utilize Room, an Android persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, ensuring reliable management of encrypted passwords.
AES Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a highly secure encryption algorithm, to protect sensitive data stored locally on the device.
Android Architecture Components: Our app follows best practices in Android app development by implementing architecture components such as ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding, enhancing maintainability and testability.
Material Design: The app adheres to Google's Material Design guidelines, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience across different Android devices and versions.

Your passwords are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a highly secure encryption algorithm widely used for protecting sensitive data.
AES encryption ensures that your passwords remain secure even if your device is compromised or accessed by unauthorized users.
Additionally, our app utilizes a secure Room database to manage encrypted passwords locally on your device.
Room is an Android persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier to manage and access encrypted data.
By storing passwords in a secure database locally on your device, we add an extra layer of protection to your sensitive information, minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

Room Database:
--------------
This application utilizes a secure Room database to manage encrypted passwords locally on your device.
Room is an Android persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier to manage and access encrypted data.
The use of Room ensures efficient and reliable storage of passwords, with built-in features such as data validation and query optimization.
By storing passwords in a secure database locally on your device, we add an extra layer of protection to your sensitive information, minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

Intuitive User Interface:
-------------------------
This app features a clean and intuitive user interface, designed to make password management effortless.
The user interface is thoughtfully crafted with a minimalist design, focusing on ease of use and clarity of information.
Features such as clear labeling, intuitive icons, and logical layout contribute to the overall usability of the app.
Whether you're adding a new password, editing an existing one, or generating a strong password, the user interface guides you through each step with minimal effort.
